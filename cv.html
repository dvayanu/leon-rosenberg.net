					<td>2004 - 2007</td>
					<td>Architect, Lead Developer, Team Lead, FriendScout 24 GmbH, Munich (Freelancer)<br>
FriendScout24 is the leading dating platform in the german market. With 2.7 million profiles in the database, huge amount of concurrent online users (NDA) and over 150 millions PIs, the platform has extremely high requirements to the system architecture, scalability and reliability. Since the previous version of the platform had reached it limits, my task was to design and develop a new platform without scalability limits, which had to serve factor 5 users on same amount of hardware. This platform was launched at November 7, 2004 and has proven to be a success story (increased performance, increased reliability, increased customer satisfaction, increased conversion rate after all). After the launch I kept on working for the company, implementing critical projects, like payment or internationalization. More details on request.
<br><em>Update 2013: As far as I know the architecture we launched 2004 is still operated by FriendScout</em>
